## Overview
In the assessment, I have used following packt APIs
- /products
- /products/<id> 
- /products/<id>/cover/small
- /products/<id>/cover/price

- All the routes are written `routes/api.php` and all are public by default.
- Packt api implementation could be found in repositories.
- Used files as cache driver
